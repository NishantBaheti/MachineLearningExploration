Hey there!

Welcome aboard!

So, here's the scoop: I put together this documentation while embarking on my epic journey through the realms of machine learning and data science.

But, here's the thing: I've got a bit of a scatterbrain, and I tend to misplace my logic, methods, algorithms, and, oh, the endless lines of code.

So, to keep all the genius stuff in one handy place, I've crafted this treasure trove. It's like my own personal cheat sheet to quickly dive into topics when I need 'em.

Now, let me spill the beans on my secret sauce. Most of the content in here comes from a bunch of free courses, juicy videos, brainy research papers, and some good old dusty books.
And, just in case I've messed up the credits, don't be shy - give me a holler. I'll make things right ASAP!

Let's dive into the wonderful world of ML and data science together, shall we?

The amateur's guide to explore machine learning
====================================================

HELLO THERE !!!

`What is this documentation?` This doc is my exploration of machine learning and data science that I am developing as I am learning. `Why am i creating this?` I am learning things at a slow pace and I tend to forget logics/ methods/ formulas/ codes. To keep everything at one place so that I can go through the topic quickly for reference. Now just to help other people who are also starting to learn these topics, this doc may be helpful. There is already a lot of content available over the internet. This is just another doc but it is developed from the perspective of a learner with an enthusiasm. `Is the math, method or logic correct?` Validation of the content is done by people who are visiting it. On the other hand, sometimes results are proof :-D. I understand the topic mostly from a free course, video, research paper or book and try it (mostly references are mentioned with the topic). If It is giving results then great, if not then I try something else.

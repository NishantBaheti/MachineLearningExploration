*HELLO THERE !!!*

Welcome. 

I started this documentation as my exploration of **machine learning & data science** that I am developing as I am learning.

I usually forget logics, methods, algorithms and code. Hence to keep everything at one place so that I can go through the topic quickly as referenced. For the people who are visiting it and also starting to learn these topics, this doc might be helpful.

On the validation of the content, It is generally done by the folks who are reading it. On the other hand, sometimes results are the proofs asked.

Source of the content mostly from a free course, video, research paper and book (most of the references are mentioned with the topic).

**If I haven't mentioned your reference correctly then let me know, I'll correct the situation.**

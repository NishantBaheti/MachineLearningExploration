`What is this documentation?`
    This doc is my exploration that I am developing as I am learning.


`Why am i creating this?` 
    I am learning things at a slow pace and I tend to forget methods/ formulas/ code s. 
    To keep everything at one place so that I can go through the topic quickly for reference. 
    Now just to help other people who are also starting to learn these topics, this doc may be helpful.
    
    There is already a lot of content available over the internet. 
    This is just another doc but it is developed from the perspective of an average person with an enthusiasm for data wonders.


`Is the math, method or logic correct?`
    Validation of the content is done by people who are visiting it.
    On the other hand, sometimes results are proof :-D .

    I understand the topic from a course, youtube video, research paper or book and try it.
    If It is giving results then awesome, if not then try something else.
